# Implementation of SPTTE

This repository contains the code used in our paper: [SPTTE: A Spatiotemporal Probabilistic Framework for Travel Time Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18484).

## Requirements

To run the code, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu (tested on versions 16.04 and 18.04)
- **Programming Languages**:
  - [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) >= 1.0
  - Python >= 3.6
- **Deep Learning Framework**:
  - PyTorch >= 0.4 (tested on versions 0.4 and 1.0)

To install the required Julia packages, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(["HDF5", "CSV", "DataFrames", "Distances", "StatsBase", "JSON", "Lazy", "JLD2", "ArgParse"])'
```

To install the required Python packages, you can use the provided `requirements.txt` file. This file lists all necessary dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

Harbin: The dataset consists of over **1 million trips** collected by **13,000+ taxis**.

Chengdu: The dataset consists of over **1.4 million taxis** collecting more than **1.4 billion GPS records**.

### Download Dataset

Download the dataset from the following link:

Harbin: [Download Dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tdgarnn28CM01o9hbeKLUiJ1o1lskrqA)

Chengdu: [Download Dataset](https://challenge.datacastle.cn/v3/cmptDetail.html?id=175)

Extracting data from OpenStreetMap can be used to obtain the road network. You can download the road network data for Chengdu from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and use it for map matching.


### Data Format

Each `.h5` file contains multiple trips recorded on a given day. Each trip consists of three fields:

- `lon` (longitude)
- `lat` (latitude)
- `tms` (timestamp)

To read `.h5` files, use the [`readtripsh5`](https://github.com/ChenXu02/ProbETA/tree/main/julia/Trip.jl#L28) function in Julia. If using your own dataset, refer to `readtripsh5` to format your trajectories correctly into `.h5` files.

## Preprocessing

### Map Matching

Before training, trips must be map-matched using the [Barefoot](https://github.com/boathit/barefoot) matching server. Follow the instructions in the Barefoot repository to set up the required servers.

Once the servers are running, execute the following command to match trips:

```bash
cd SPTTE/julia
julia -p 6 mapmatch.jl --inputpath ../data/h5path --outputpath ../data/jldpath
```

Here, `6` represents the number of available CPU cores.

## Training the Model

Before training, ensure the road network PostgreSQL server is set up by following the instructions in [Barefoot](https://github.com/boathit/barefoot).

To train the model, navigate to the `Model/ProbETA` directory and run:

```bash
cd SPTTE/Model/SPTTE
python main.py -data_path ../data/datapath
```
The dataset does not need to be manually split beforehand; it will be randomly divided into training and test sets automatically.
Once training is complete, the model will automatically run evaluation on the test set.
